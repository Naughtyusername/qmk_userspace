* Tasks

** TODO slightly bump sweep timeout or
look into why it randomly disconnects mid type, it cant be any key combo we are htiting but it is odd, does feel like crashing the micro-controller sometimes.

** TODO combo keys i think i got it!
as is backspace,
zx is del

fg is tab,
vb could be Leader

xc is still left open for some handy dandy deal, but i like this idea. with top row one shot mods this is super handy to have! makes an even smaller board very possible to use, though im not sure id give up thumb keys easily.

** TODO debounce might still be too low on the sweep, there is a bit of chatter sometimes still, 5ms more on each value?
[2026-02-10 Tue 12:40]

** TODO our combo for delete (probably on both qmk and zmk, zmk for sure)
isnt using bs_del, we do need to make a style choice on that. honestly im 5050 on it still, i misfire it all the time, having seperate del on zx is fine which we already wrote about. but make a choice or add in del soon, i do use it somewhat often

* TODO zx DEL?
odd but maybe? or then key next to it is much easier to hit for leader
xc , consider

** TODO timing issue on qmk having more misfires on qmk than zmk
but maybe im just lazy typing or not used to the big keys rn but keep an eye out
misfiring yh numword a couple times now too
[2026-02-08 Sun 07:29]

** TODO timing for chordal quick tap or flow tap i forget the qmk setting
but we need to reduce it, the one that lets you hit home row mod key and then akey on the other hand and send the key super+a instantly, we need a delay, its the reason we misfire when typing to fast. >100 wpm triggers it.

** TODO change some lower layer symbols
having comma on the right hand but not in the right spot is to hard to remember, it has to be on a non pinky ring finger, put it under . we dont seem to have an issues
remembering to use that one. so do that and shift the other symbols around to a more logical position
[2026-02-08 Sun 03:14]

** TODO Dynamic macros
zmk doesnt have these yet (iirc, double check)
but qmk does, might as well set up the framework for it, i use them in emacs
all the time, but i could see use outside and in games for sure
simple combos to toggle them
- [ ]  Record / Stop recording combo
- [ ]  Play recorded macro
- [ ]  then im not sure if they get overwritten or if there is an amount that are stored? figure that out
- [ ]  do we need a delete macro function?
Food for thought, would come in handy sometimes, not pressing tho.

** TODO something we could add but we would have to tweak qmk
this is a wild and weird idea and actually might be a burdern on qmk becuase the fall through on there is actually super handy, but zmk doesnt have the fall through unless we remove the layer locks on each combo

but what we could do for the lower layer is add a bunch of unique to that layer combos. might not be worth it but just thought about it
[2026-02-08 Sun 02:23]

** TODO leader key maybe finally?
would be nice to have a combo trigger a leader then we
- [ ] leader_combo s e send email
- [ ] leader_combo s g send github url github.com/naughtyusername/
- [ ] leader_combo
- [ ] leader_combo
- [ ]

** DONE we could also change
fg _ and
vb - to be one shifted to the left to make those more ergo
then

then we have the quotes in a nice logical spots to hit since we use those somewhat often. that still leaves logical positioning for math operators on the left hand as well. and then for the more macro intresting things like the previious todo suggested of
: space ^ e.g. : ^
for proc(game: ^Game)

we could have on a 3 finger combo somewhere maybe
[2026-02-08 Sun 04:11]

** DONE jkl combo
- [X] for double quote  "
 [2026-02-06 Fri 22:15]

** DONE for the symbols layer, maybe have tab be spacebar? and for the numbers layer also have tab be spaacebar? or look into smart numbers, honestly if we could do caps word but for numbers that would fix all my number greivances
[2026-02-05 Thu 07:58]

** DONE add a comma on lower layer QMK/ZMK would be nice for numbers while coding
it also fits in well on n i belive

also maybe make / work for caps word continue lists
[2026-02-04 Wed 01:47]

** DONE add - onto the lower layer, would be handy to have 25-56 etc.
- [X]  / was also suggested. at this point it is worth considering plus
times, etc. also, there should be just enough room. combos should still
 - [X] pass through also if i were to unlock them from base and vim, worth considering also

[2026-02-04 Wed 04:22]

** TODO modifier key plus bs_del doesnt send modified version
similar to other issues we encoutered with hrm's, this may be fixed on our next flash tho with that change we made
