* QMK Userspace Summary

* Project Overview
This is my QMK userspace that provides a unified typing experience across multiple mechanical keyboards. The userspace contains shared layers, keycodes, and configurations that work consistently on all supported keyboards.

** Supported Keyboards**
- Mitosis (46 keys) - 3x5 Split ergo with 2x4 thumb clusters
- Halcyon Corne (42 keys) - Split with TFT display and Cirque trackpad  
- Kyria (50 keys) - Split with encoders and 5 thumb keys each side
- Planck EZ Glow (47 keys) - Ortholinear with RGB matrix
- Zima (12 keys) - Macropad with encoder and OLED

** Core Architecture**

*** Userspace Structure:*
- naughtyusername.h - Main header with layers, keycodes, home row mods
- wrappers.h - Layout wrapper macros for different keyboard form factors
- config.h - Shared configuration (tapping terms, HRM settings)
- naughtyusername.c - Main implementation (per-key tapping terms, chordal hold)
- keyrecords.c - Tap dances, combos, key overrides
- rules.mk - Build configuration for shared features

*** Layer System:*
- _BASE - QWERTY with GACS home row mods
- _LOWER - Numbers and media controls  
- _RAISE - Symbols and programming operators
- _FUNCTION - F-keys and navigation
- _ADJUST - System controls and mouse keys (tri-layer)
- _GAMING - No home row mods for gaming

*** Key Features Implemented**
- Home Row Mods (GACS: Gui/Alt/Ctrl/Shift)
- Tap Dance (Q double-tap = Escape)
- Combos (J+K = Escape)
- Caps Word with 3s timeout
- Tri-layer support (LOWER+RAISE = ADJUST)
- Custom keycodes for programming (:=, ->, ::, ..=)
- Per-key tapping term tuning
- Flow tap for fast typing

*** Technical Highlights**
- Uses QMK userspace feature for code sharing
- Layout wrapper system with C preprocessor macros
- 3x5 alpha grid core, adapts to each keyboard's thumb cluster
- Supports both 5-column and 6-column layouts
- Weak function pattern for keymap overrides
- Comprehensive documentation in headers

**Current Status**
- Well-structured and documented
- Multiple keyboards supported
- Advanced features properly configured
- Good separation of concerns between shared and keyboard-specific code
